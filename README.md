# Streamlining Customer Orders and Payments in Iron Trading

Welcome to the repository for the BDM Capstone Project: **Streamlining Customer Orders and Payments in Iron Trading**. This project was completed as part of the IIT Madras BS Degree Program and focuses on operational optimization for Aditya Iron Traders, a leading MSME in Delhi’s iron trading sector.

## Project Overview

**Organization:** Aditya Iron Traders, Naraina Loha Mandi, New Delhi  
**Industry:** Iron and iron products trading (primarily B2B)  
**Project Duration:** April 2024 – August 2024  
**Author:** Abhishek Jha (Roll No. 23f3004013), IIT Madras

This capstone project analyzes five months of transactional, operational, and payment data to identify and solve key business challenges in cost management, cash flow, and logistics.

---

## Objectives

- **Reduce operational costs** by optimizing customer order frequency and labor allocation.
- **Improve cash flow** by addressing delayed customer payments.
- **Enhance logistics efficiency** by analyzing and rebalancing regional delivery operations.

---

## Data & Methodology

**Data Sources:**
- Transactional sales data (136 business customers, order dates, amounts, locations)
- Pending payments and payment delays (days outstanding)
- Operational expenses (labor charges, salaries, indirect costs)
- Geographical data (customer PIN codes)
- Profit & loss summaries

**Data Handling:**
- Data was provided directly by Aditya Iron Traders, with formal authorization for academic analysis.
- Data cleaning involved removing duplicates, invalid/canceled entries, and standardizing fields.
- Payment delays were binned (0–90, 91–180, 181–270, 271–360 days) for segment analysis.
- PIN codes were grouped to analyze regional sales and logistics patterns.

**Tools Used:**
- Microsoft Excel (data cleaning, aggregation, visualization)
- Pivot tables, conditional formatting, basic statistics

## Key Problem Statements

1. **Operational Cost Inefficiency:**  
   Frequent small-value orders increase labor and transportation costs without proportional revenue gain.

2. **Delayed Customer Payments:**  
   Extended payment cycles block working capital and strain cash flow.

3. **Logistics Bottlenecks:**  
   High sales concentration in specific zones causes delivery delays and resource strain, while other regions remain under-served.

---

## Major Findings

- **Labor charges** accounted for 30–43% of revenue in peak months; months with more consolidated orders saw a notable drop in labor costs and a rise in net profit margin.
- **Payment delays**: 55% of customers pay within 90 days, but over 40% delay payments up to or beyond 180 days, blocking up to 14% of working capital.
- **Regional sales**: Over 53% of revenue comes from a single PIN code (Zone 13), with another 35% from two adjacent zones, leading to delivery congestion and missed opportunities elsewhere.

## Recommendations

### 1. Order Consolidation & Cost Optimization
- **Introduce order consolidation incentives:**  
  Volume-based discounts, free delivery for larger orders, and scheduled ordering windows.
- **Minimum order thresholds:**  
  Encourage fewer, larger transactions to reduce per-order labor and transport costs.
- **Digital order management:**  
  Automate order intake, monitor patterns, and forecast demand for efficient resource allocation.

### 2. Payment Policy Reform
- **Structured payment terms:**  
  Early payment discounts (e.g., 2% off for payment within 10 days), tiered incentives for faster settlements.
- **Credit profiling:**  
  Segment customers by payment behavior, set dynamic credit limits, and automate reminders.
- **Loyalty rewards:**  
  Offer future benefits for timely payments to shift customer habits.

### 3. Logistics Enhancement
- **Zone-based delivery scheduling:**  
  Fixed delivery windows for high-demand zones to optimize routes and reduce delays.
- **Resource allocation:**  
  Cross-train staff and deploy extra resources during peak periods.
- **Micro-warehousing:**  
  Pilot small storage hubs in high-density regions for faster fulfillment.
